# Plan

### Part 1 - PyGame Puzzle

* Each level of this puzzle will have a recorded video message as a reward for completion
* The final level will simply have a location of a locker, and the password (probably a locker in our own building)
* That locker should contain the coloring book

### Part 2 - Flowers and Coloring Book

* Need to solicit her friends for their favorite picture of them together, and a short (one or two sentence) message
* Using Inkscape, I will create a coloring book outline version of those pictures, and combine them into a book, which I will then print out at Kinkos or somewhere

### Part 3 - Helinox Chair

* Self explanatory
